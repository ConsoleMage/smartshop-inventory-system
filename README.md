# smartshop-inventory-system

This is the peer-graded assignment for "Database Integration and Management," the sixth course in a 12-course series in the Microsoft Full-Stack Developer Professional Certificate program.

### Introduction:

Imagine you are a database engineer tasked with developing the SmartShop Inventory System for a fictional retail company, SmartShop. This system must manage inventory data across multiple stores, providing real-time insights into stock levels, sales trends, and supplier information. The company requires:

A database to store and retrieve inventory data efficiently.

Complex queries to analyze trends and relationships between products, sales, and suppliers.

Optimized database operations to ensure high performance and scalability.

Your goal is to leverage Microsoft Copilot to create, debug, and optimize SQL queries, ensuring the system meets performance and accuracy requirements. This project will span three activities and culminate in a comprehensive inventory management database.
